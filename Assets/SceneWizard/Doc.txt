* Scene Wizard documentation *

## What is it for?
	It creates a custom window to manage scenes from a specific folder of your choice. 
	You can switch between scenes faster without looking for these scenes on the Assets folder.

## How to open the window?
    Window -> EMD Tools -> Scene Wizard 

## What else?
    It also creates an asset on the root folder called SceneWizard_Config.
	It's a scriptable object that stores the scenes from the chosen folders and other user options.
